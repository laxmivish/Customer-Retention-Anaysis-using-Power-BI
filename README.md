# Customer-Retention-Anaysis-using-Power-BI 
The project aimed to define proper Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the retention manager and develop a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and drive customer retention efforts effectively. The selected KPIs are designed to align with the goal of reducing customer churn and increasing retention rates.
Customer Churn Rate: Measure the percentage of customers who have terminated their contracts.
The retention manager dashboard will visually represent these KPIs, providing a clear and concise overview of customer retention performance. The dashboard will feature interactive visualizations such as Pie charts, Stacked Column chart,Donut chart and tables to monitor trends, identify at-risk customers, and track the success of retention strategies. The dashboard will empower the retention manager to make data-driven decisions, implement targeted initiatives, and drive sustainable growth by retaining valuable customers.
